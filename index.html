      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Senior Communications Specialist working in the commercial real estate industry. I also run a small freelance graphic design and photography business. I attended Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, and graduated in 2012 with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with a major in Marketing. Currently, I am studying full stack web development at the University of Richmond.</p>

      <p>I enjoy traveling, indoor gardening, gaming, reading, cosplaying, dancing, and being surrounded by cats.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My goal is to become a software engineer in the Richmond, VA area.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I started coding in HTML and CSS as a hobby when I was a kid back in 2002 (does anyone remember Neopets?). Ever since then, coding has been something that I have enjoyed and that makes time fly. I have even used some HTML and CSS in my work as a marketer. Now, with the encouragement of a friend who also recently changed careers to software engineering, I am ready to take this hobby that I've always enjoyed and turn it into a high-paying career.</p>
